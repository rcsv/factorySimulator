 * An automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV) is a mobile
 * robot that follows makers or wires in the floor, or uses vision or lasers.
 * They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around
 * a manufacturing facility or a warehouse. Application of the automatic guided

 * ## Introduction Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) increase efficiency and
 * reduce costs by helping to automate a manufacturing facility or warehouse. The
 * first AGV was invented by Barrett Electronics in 1953. The AGV can tow
 * objects behind them in trailers to which they can autonomously attach. The
 * trailers can be used to move raw materials or finished product. The AGV can
 * also store objects on a bed. The objects can be placed on a set of motorized
 * rollers (conveyor) and then pushed off by reversing them. AGVs are employed
 * in nearly every industry, including, plup, paper, metals, newspaper, and
 * general manufacturing. Transporting materials such as food, linen or medicine
 * in hospitals is also done.
